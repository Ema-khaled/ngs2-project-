Hello everybody, the following is the scripts or steps for variant calling:

## create and activate the conda env if you did not have it:
$ conda create -y --name ngs1 python=3.6
$ conda activate ngs1

##Sequence Alignment
  #1-Download the reference file (human genome) from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly and put it in:
$ mkdir -p ~/workdir/sample_data && cd ~/workdir/sample_data

  #2-Download the secound sample_data Fastq files (the accession:SRX5059368,the run: SRR8241113, ILLUMINA (Illumina HiSeq 2000) run: 29.5M spots, 5.3G bases, 2.7Gb downloads):
$ mkdir -p ~/workdir/fqData && cd ~/workdir/fqData
$ conda install -c bioconda sra-tools
##To download the run by accession using prefetch (The actual file will be downloaded to the cache area in my filesystem):
$ prefetch SRR8241113
......
$ srapath SRR8241113.sra
....
The run file is compressed, occupying on disk about:
$ ls -l /home/you/ncbi/public/sra/SRR8241113.sra
......
## Now we will convert the downloaded runs to fastq:
$ fastq-dump SRR8241113.sra
.....
## By Looking at the downloaded fastq file, we can see it is complete:
$ ls -l SRR8241113.fastq
....
