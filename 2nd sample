Hello everybody, the following is the scripts or steps for variant calling:

## create and activate the conda env if you did not have it:
$ conda create -y --name ngs1 python=3.6
$ conda activate ngs1

##Sequence Alignment
  #1-Download the reference file (human genome) from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/ and ubload it in the following directory:
$ mkdir -p ~/workdir/sample_data && cd ~/workdir/sample_data
$ gunzip GRCh38_latest_genomic.fna.gz
## By Looking at the downloaded fasta file, we can see it is completed and it is about 4 GB!!:
$ ls -tral GRCh38_latest_genomic.fna
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ngs ngs 3313061631 Feb 25 23:53 GRCh38_latest_genomic.fna

  #2-Download the secound sample_data Fastq files (the accession:SRX5059368,the run: SRR8241113, ILLUMINA (Illumina HiSeq 2000) run: 29.5M spots, 5.3G bases, 2.7Gb downloads):
$ mkdir -p ~/workdir/fqData && cd ~/workdir/fqData

##To download the run by accession using prefetch (The actual file will be downloaded to the cache area in my filesystem):
$ conda install -c bioconda sra-tools
$ prefetch SRR8241113

## To Know the path of the downloaded runs:
$ srapath SRR8241113
/home/ngs/workdir/fqData/SRR8241113/SRR8241113.sra

##The run file is compressed, occupying on disk about 2911751441 (about 3 GB):
$ ls -tral /home/ngs/workdir/fqData/SRR8241113/SRR8241113.sra
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ngs ngs 2911751441 Feb 25 23:20 /home/ngs/workdir/fqData/SRR8241113/SRR8241113.sra

## Now we will convert the downloaded runs to a fastq file formate via the following command:
$ fastq-dump SRR8241113/SRR8241113.sra

## By Looking at the downloaded fastq file by ls -tral, we can see it is completed and it is about 14 GB!!:
$ ls -tral SRR8241113.fastq
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ngs ngs 14172139840 Feb 25 23:35 SRR8241113.fastq

## By Looking at the downloaded fastq file by head, we can see the reads:
$ head SRR8241113.fastq
